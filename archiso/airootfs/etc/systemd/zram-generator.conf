# Aegis Linux - ZRAM Configuration
# =============================================================================
# Compressed RAM-based swap for better performance than disk swap
# =============================================================================

[zram0]
# Use zstd compression for best ratio
compression-algorithm = zstd

# Size relative to RAM (e.g., half of RAM)
# For 16GB RAM, this creates 8GB of compressed swap
zram-size = ram / 2

# Swap priority (higher than disk swap)
swap-priority = 100

# Filesystem for zram device
# swap = use as swap (recommended)
# ext2/ext4 = use as block device
